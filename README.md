The thesis work of Jacob Shpiece, at Drexel University. 
Project title is "Non-Parametric Detection of Dark Halos in Galaxy Clusters."

A brief formulation of the problem:
  - Modern theory of structure formation holds that dark matter halos will form from initial perturbations in the early universe.
  - These halos will interact, accumulating matter and underoging mergers when they come too close to each other.
  - This gives way to a self similar, heirarchical structure of halos and nested subhalos, building up galaxies and galaxy clusters in our universe. 
  - Baryonic matter (which produces light) will accumulate inside of the gravity wells of these halos. HOWEVER, smaller subhalos in a galaxy cluster environment can be 'missed' by baryonic matter, resulting in a smaller light signature relative to their mass.
  - Many gravitational lensing studies rely on the assumption that the light distribution in a galaxy cluster traces the mass distribution of the cluster. These studies therefore are prone to undercounting 'dark halos' that have less light associated with them.

The project: Construct a statistical test for locating dark matter halos without knowledge of the light distribution of the cluster being probed. 

Value: Such a test represents a potential probe of the low mass end of the subhalo mass function (SHMF), as it is smaller halos that are likely to be undercounted due to the above problem. More precise measurements of this region of the SHMF have the potential to constrain the properties of dark matter or different models of the early universe.
