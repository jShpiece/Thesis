# Degrees of Freedom

The number of degrees of freedom is typically written as
$$d = n - k$$
Where n gives the number of independent data points and k is the number of free parameters - that is, parameters that are allowed to vary. In a lensing scenario we have Ns sources and Nl lenses - each source has four numbers associated with it, two for shear and two for flexion, while each lens has three free parameters, two for position and one for amplitude. This means that the number of degrees of freedom is
$$d = 4N_{s}- 3N_l$$
